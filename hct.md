# Hungarian Cookie Treasures

## Ingredients

*    8 oz cream cheese, softened
*     2 c  butter, softened
*     1 c  granulated sugar
*     5 c  all-purpose flour
* 1 1/2 c  jam or preserves of choice (or nut filling)
*     1 c  powdered sugar, for dusting

Note: Don't over-chill the dough.  We found it easier to work with
closer to room temperature.

1. Use a stand mixer with the paddle attachment, combine the cream
   cheese, butter, and sugar.  Mix on medium speed until well blended.

2. Add the flour, one cup at a time, mixing until evenly incorporated.
   Remove the dough from the mixture and press it into a ball.  Wrap
   in plastic and allow to rest in the refrigerator for 1 hour.

3. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.  Sprinkle some powdered sugar on
   a smooth countertop or pastry board and roll dough out to
   approx. 1/4 inch-thick sheets.  Cut dough into 2-inch circles.
   Re-roll excess dough as needed.

4. Place 1 teaspoonful of jam or preserves in the center of half the
   circles.

5. Wet the cookie edges around the jam or preserves with your finger.
   Then place a second circle over the jam or preserves and firmly
   press down around the edges to encompass the jam or preserves.
   Take a form around the perimeter to seal the jam or preserves in
   tightly (like you would for a pie crust).  Repeat this process
   until you have used up all the dough.

6. Place the cookies on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and
   bake for 8-10 minutes or until cookies begin to brown.

7. Remove from the oven and place onto cookie racks.

8. If desired, dust cookies with powdered sugar.

9. These cookies keep well in the freezer for long term storage.
   However, they should be stored in an airtight container in the
   refrigerator when completely cooled.
