https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/puerquitos-piggies-recipe

## Ingredients

### Dough

* 4 1/3 cups (520g) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour, plus more for rolling
* 1 teaspoon table salt
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
* 12 ounces (340g) piloncillo, shaved or chopped*
* 3/4 cup (170g) water
* 1 teaspoon anise seeds, optional
* 1 cinnamon stick or 3/4 teaspoon cinnamon, Mexican preferred
* 2 tablespoons (42g) honey
* 12 tablespoons (170g) unsalted butter, at room temperature
* 2 large eggs, at room temperature

* See “tips,” below. 

### Topping

* 1 large egg, beaten with 1 tablespoon cold water (egg wash)

## Instructions

### Step 1

Start by weighing your flour or measuring it by gently spooning it
into a cup, then sweeping off any excess. In a large bowl or the bowl
of a stand mixer fitted with the flat beater, combine the flour, salt,
baking powder, and baking soda.

### Step 2

In a medium saucepan with high sides, combine the piloncillo, water,
anise seeds, and cinnamon. Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Adjust
the heat to maintain a slow simmer, stirring regularly with a flexible
spatula until most of the piloncillo dissolves and a thick syrup the
consistency of molasses forms, about 20 minutes. The syrup should
measure between 250°F and 255°F on a digital thermometer.

### Step 3

Remove the pot from the stove and carefully remove the cinnamon stick,
if using. Stir in the honey until fully incorporated. Then stir in the
butter until melted. (The butter will not fully incorporate; that’s
OK.)

### Step 4

Create a well in the center of the dry ingredients and add the piloncillo mixture. Mix on low speed until well combined.  

### Step 5

Add the eggs one at a time, stirring to combine the first before
adding the second. The mixture will be sticky and seem more like thick
batter than dough.

### Step 6

Transfer the dough to a sheet of plastic wrap or your favorite
reusable wrap. Shape the dough into a large oval about 9" x 10" and
wrap to seal. Refrigerate the dough for at least 3 hours or overnight.

### Step 7

Once the dough has chilled, preheat the oven to 350°F with the rack in
the center position. Line 3 baking sheets with parchment or silicone
mats, or lightly grease.

### Step 8

Flour your work surface generously and divide the dough into 4
pieces. Working with 1 piece of dough at a time (return the other 3
pieces to the refrigerator), roll the dough to about 1/4" thick,
adding more flour as needed to prevent sticking. If the dough begins
to crack, that’s OK; simply press or pinch it back together.

### Step 9

Using a 3 3/4" to 4" pig-shaped cookie cutter that has been dipped in
flour, cut the dough into cookies. Transfer the cookies to a baking
sheet as you go, spacing them about 1" apart. Re-roll the dough scraps
and cut out additional cookies until all the dough from the first
piece is used.

### Step 10

Brush the puerquitos with egg wash and bake for 12 to 14 minutes, or
until evenly puffed all over and slightly firm to the touch. Allow
them to cool on the pan for about 5 minutes before transferring them
to a rack to cool completely.

### Step 11

While the first tray bakes, work with another piece of dough to fill
the second baking sheet with cookies. Continue until all the dough is
used, baking one tray of cookies at a time.

### Step 12

**Storage information:** Serve puerquitos at room temperature; store
leftover puerquitos in an airtight container at room temperature for
up to 4 days.

## Tips from our Bakers

* Piloncillo (also called panela) is an unrefined whole cane sugar
  that’s often used in Central and Latin American cuisine. It's
  slightly more earthy and caramelly tasting than conventional brown
  sugar. Find it at specialty grocery stores or online at retailers.

* To make gluten-free puerquitos: Substitute 4 1/3 cups (520g)
  Gluten-Free Measure for Measure Flour for the all-purpose
  flour. Once mixed, the gluten-free dough will clean the sides of the
  mixing bowl and be firmer than dough made with all-purpose flour. It
  should still be wrapped and refrigerated before rolling and baking.
